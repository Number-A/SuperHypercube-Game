This project was made in the context of my Computer Graphics class at Concordia.

This is a simple game where you have to fit the shape in the hole. You have to move the shape in the right orientation in order to make it fit.

We were in teams of 3 for the project and my main contribution was on the environment of the landscape of the game along with the chunck spawning of the map.
